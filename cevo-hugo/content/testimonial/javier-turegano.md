Cevo engineers did a great job integrating their services into our IT team recently and help us manage our AWS costs more efficiently.  Cevo helped us introduce more efficient tagging and reporting capabilities that have unlocked internal back charges, termination of unclaimed resources via an elegant event driven implementation, and the foundations for saving recommendations. Our target is to achieve at least 15% savings through this implementation in this financial year.
